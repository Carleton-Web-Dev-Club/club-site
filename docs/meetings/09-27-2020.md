### Theme Competition - deadline by ASAP
Organize a theme competition. One of the main criteria is to have accessible color schema. Ideally by Wednesday (09/30/2020) so that we can get a page up for hacakathon(October 3 and 4).

### How to split responsibilities? (Big picture)
* Saihaj - Backend Maintainer
* Aidan - Frontend Maintainer
* Jimmy - Docs Maintainer and head of operations/integration/makes-sense-ability

### ESlint:
We currently using [airbnb eslint](https://airbnb.io/javascript/) with some rules that (@saihaj) likes. Update the config to have following: 
* Use semicolons
* Arrow Functions only
* Remove rule for space in parens and arrays
  * Arrays should look like this [1, 2, 3]

### Site Elements ([*From last meeting*](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1puhmRBvf4YVacK-vKcCaOpukcZN7uJ7qLiQ6ah7ZiVQ))
